            <h1>My Favorite Albums</h1>
            <p>I go to a lot of concerts and I collect vinyl, so I thought 
               I would make a list of some of my favorite albums.</p>

                    <h3>The Who - Quadrophenia</h3>
                        <img src="images/who.jpg" style="width:300px; height:300px" alt=""></a>
                        <p>This is definitely my all time favorite. I'm not a huge fan of the movie
                        nor of this band but this album really makes my ears happy.</p>

                    <h3>The Raconteurs - Consolers of the Lonely</h3>
                        <img src="images/raconteurs.jpg" style="width:300px; height:300px" alt=""></a>
                        <p>I love all of Jack White's bands. He is my favorite artist and is one of the
                            reasons I started collecting vinyl. I own all of his albums and one of them is 
                            worth a thousand dollars.</p>

                    <h3>Portugal, the Man - In The Mountain In The Cloud</h3>
                        <img src="images/mountain.jpg" style="width:300px; height:300px" alt=""></a>
                        <p>This band is amazing. I actually just saw them live for the first time a few months 
                            ago at The Pageant. They have four albums I particularly enjoy but this is probably my
                            favorite if I had to pick one.</p>

                    <h3>Father John Misty - Fear Fun</h3>
                        <img src="images/fearfun.jpg" style="width:300px; height:300px" alt=""></a>        
                        <p>I'm super excited I get to see Father John again this Friday at The Peabody Opera House.</p>

                    <h3>The Mars Volta - De-Loused In The Comatorium</h3>
                        <img src="images/deloused.jpg" style="width:300px; height:300px" alt=""></a>
                        <p>I have seen these guys a couple times. The first time I saw them was in April 2008 and it was
                            the best concert I have ever been to. They were touring their album The Bedlam in Goliath and
                            played for 3 hours with no opening band. I remember seeing the drummer lose his stick at one
                            point and pulled another out of his pocket without missing a beat. Insane band I wish they were
                            still together.</p>

                    <h3>Shakey Graves - Roll The Bones</h3>
                        <img src="images/shakey.jpg" style="width:300px; height:300px" alt=""></a>
                        <p>This guy is incredible. He is usually a one man band, though sometimes he has a group.
                             He creates kick drums out of samsonite luggage and plays blues\folk music.
                             I would definitely recommend giving this guy a listen.</p>
